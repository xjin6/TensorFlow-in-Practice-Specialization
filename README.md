# 1. TensorFlow in Practice Specilization

Hi all, I have been recently learning the specilization course of TensorFlow published by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). There are 4 courses in this specilization:
- [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow/home/welcome)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow/home/welcome)
- [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow/home/welcome)
- [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction/home/welcome)

# 2. About this Repo
For this repo, I'll share my notes, codes, and answers of coding assignments. And you know, the most difficult problems in Python or any other programming languge are some "too specific problems" (e.g., spelling, capital, tab, or the inconsistence between your Python versiona and computer version). Also, I'll share some experiences that I overcome the specific problems.

The source code of each course of this specilization could be found in the 4 Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files and currently only one could be seen.

# 3. Progress Update
## 3.1 Intro to TensorFlow for AI, ML, and DL

Finally, please feel free to contact me or leave me an issue in GitHub. It would be great to have some future discussions with all of you!
